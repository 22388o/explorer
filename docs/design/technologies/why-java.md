# Why Java?

First, picking a tech stack that optimizes for quick prototyping seems tempting, but would mean significant
re-engineering down the line to scale with our ambitions (Twitter had to move from Ruby to Java because of growth).

- There are millions of Java developers around the world, and Java being one of the dominant tech stacks in the
  enterprise world, it is easy to find developers to work on the project.
- Java is a proven and scalable platform for backend services, which is exactly what's needed. We made more adventurous
  choice on the front-end (htmx).
- There's a thriving open-source ecosystem to tap into. For virtually every task you want to achieve, there's a
  battle-tested open-source library available to get the job done.
