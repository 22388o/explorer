# Universe - Design documentation

## Introduction

Universe is a service and a service may know about multiple assets (Multiverse) or only about a single output (Pocket
Universe).

An Asset Universe is a publicly auditable merkle-sum sparse merkle tree (MS-SMT) over one or several assets. Unlike the
normal Taproot Asset tree, a Universe isnâ€™t used to custody Taproot Assets. Instead, a Universe commits to a subset of
the history of one, or many assets. A close analogue to a public Universe is a block explorer

The announcement is [here](https://lightning.engineering/posts/2023-05-16-taproot-assets-v0.2/) and The BIP is [here]
(https://github.com/Roasbeef/bips/blob/da3049f2f65b1c1c2b2caa7164449192b791bd29/bip-tap-universe.mediawiki). There is
also a video explaining the 0.2 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qi7VOvKe5o&feature=youtu.be).

## API & test server

We can use the lighting labs test server:
https://testnet.universe.lightning.finance/v1/taproot-assets/universe/leaves/asset-id/02a4d3ce40a0d96deb7dcbd1eb565b8c46e4f5366260cecf848364b2a7fb2c5a

The following methods are available without macaroon on a universe server:

- [AssetRoots](https://lightning.engineering/api-docs/api/taproot-assets/universe/asset-roots)
- [QueryAssetRoots](https://lightning.engineering/api-docs/api/taproot-assets/universe/query-asset-roots)
- [AssetLeafKeys](https://lightning.engineering/api-docs/api/taproot-assets/universe/asset-leaf-keys)
- [AssetLeaves](https://lightning.engineering/api-docs/api/taproot-assets/universe/asset-leaves)
- [QueryProof](https://lightning.engineering/api-docs/api/taproot-assets/universe/query-proof)
- [InsertProof](https://lightning.engineering/api-docs/api/taproot-assets/universe/insert-proof)

The complete API is [here](https://lightning.engineering/api-docs/category/universe-service/index.html).

You can see the database script of the taproot assets
daemon [here](https://github.com/lightninglabs/taproot-assets/blob/main/tapdb/sqlc/migrations/000007_universe.up.sql).

## What to do ?

1 - Call universe/roots to get the list of assets the universe knows about:

```bash
curl https://testnet.universe.lightning.finance/v1/taproot-assets/universe/roots | jq
```

You can search for one with:

```bash
curl `https://testnet.universe.lightning.finance/v1/taproot-assets/universe/roots/asset-id/f84238ffd7838b663f1800d8147c9338f15688b430f6e9d8d53f148049ef3bcb | jq`
```

note : A UniverseKey is composed of the Universe ID (asset_id/group_key) and also a leaf key (outpoint || script_key)

2 - Call asset leaves (the values in the Universe MS-SMT tree) for a given asset_id or group_key. These represents
either asset issuance events (they have a genesis witness) or asset transfers that took place on chain. The leaves
contain a normal Taproot Asset proof, as well as details for the asset.

```bash
curl https://testnet.universe.lightning.finance/v1/taproot-assets/universe/leaves/asset-id/f84238ffd7838b663f1800d8147c9338f15688b430f6e9d8d53f148049ef3bcb |jq
```

3 - Create an add proof request with the proof retrieved with the previous call.
