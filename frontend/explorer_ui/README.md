## Things I did during development

## Using providers

Added Riverpod by following this documentation : https://docs-v2.riverpod.dev/docs/getting_started.
A provider is an object that encapsulates a piece of state and allows listening to that state. They are a complete
replacement for patterns like Singletons, Service Locators, Dependency Injection or InheritedWidgets.



## Useful commandes

- Run the code-generator with `flutter pub run build_runner watch`
